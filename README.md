## Workflow
- To review changes locally, run `quarto preview` (which calls `hugo serve` and automatically rerenders all changed `.qmd` and `.ipynb` files).
- To push changes online, run `quarto render` to render all `.qmd` and `.ipynb` files, then run `hugo`, to build the site for publishing. After that, just push all changes to GitHub.
