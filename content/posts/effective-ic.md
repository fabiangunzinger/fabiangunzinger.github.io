## Talking to management

1. Encourage interruptions (tell me what you already know, what you don’t understand) — goal is understanding.

- Go in grouned and confident to set the stage for the conversation.


## Managing up

- Address the question behind the question (QBQ) -- what is their true concern?

    - Signs for a QBQ: I feel like I have addressed the question, but other person doesn't seem satisfied.

    - Example: ``How is the project going?'' is ``Is the project being handled?''. So, be specific about that I'm doing and where things stand.


- Communication: main point first, then context.

    - Example:

    ``Can we do X?

    Context:
    ...''

- Share your point of view

    - Don't just ask questions, share your perspective (one of the most valuable things I bring to the table).

    ``Given X and Y, I believe Z is happening. My hypothesis is that we should do A, and here is how we could do it: ...''


- Explain your logic -- see above example


## Framing your ideas
