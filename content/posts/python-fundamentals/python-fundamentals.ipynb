    "- What is lexical analysis, and what's the etymology of the term? Lexical analysis, also called lexing or tokenizing, is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)). The root of the term is the Greek *lexis*, meaning *word*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a *token*? A string with an identified meaning, structured as a name-value tuple. Common token names (aking to parts of speech in linguistics) are *identifier*, *keyword*, *separator*, *operator*, *literal*, *comment*. For the expression `a = b + 2`, lexical analysis would yield the sequence of tokens `[(identifier, a), (operator, =), (identifier, b), (operator, +), (literal, 2)]` ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token)).\n",

    "- By default, Python reads text as Unicode code points. Hence, [encoding declarations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations) are only needed if some other encoding is required."
