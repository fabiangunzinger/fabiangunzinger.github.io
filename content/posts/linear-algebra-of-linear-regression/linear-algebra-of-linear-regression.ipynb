If we have a point $x$ in two dimensional space and a line $L$ in that same space, then the projection of $x$ onto $L$, $\\bar{x}$, is the point on $L$ that is closest to $x$. If we think of $L$ as being formed by a vector $v$ and a set of scalar multiples $c$, we want to find the one scalar multiple $c$ for which the Euclidian distance between $x$ and $\\bar{x}$, $\\sqrt{\\sum_i{(\\bar{x_i} - x})^2}$ (the index $i$ ranges over all dimensions), is minimised -- we're looking for $\\bar{x} = c^*v$, where $c^*$ is the optimal c.
