I love vim. But for quite some time now, I've questioned whether all the setup effort required, epecially for data science work (working with Jupyter Notebooks or Quarto, using a repl, inspecting tables and figures, etc.) is worth it, especially since modern IDEs like VS Code provide support for this stuff out of the box. Once I realised a few weeks ago that I can just open a Jupyer Notebook in VS Code, I decided to give it a go, and have felt, more and more, that VS Code allows me to just get work done without the need to put quite a bit of work into setup.
