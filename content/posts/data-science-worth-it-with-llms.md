Listening to Max Tegmark and Lex Friedman[^lexpodcast] talking about how ChatGPT and its offshoots might change the world made for a simultaneously fascinating and sobering experience.

It's turned me into a fan of Tegmark's, and has nudged me towards being a little more worried about humanitis futuer over the next century than I previously was. But here I want to work out a more personal issue that listening to the conversation crystalised for me: the question whether investing into technical skills like causal inference, programming, and learning vim is worth it, given that I expected them to pay off over a couple of decades, and that, in a few years, they may become irrelevant.

Thus far, I've operated on the assumption that no matter where the world is headed, the best I can do as an individual is to find work I love, do it well, invest in building skills and personal growth, and trust that things will turn out well. In practice, this meant investing studying stats, improving my Python and general programming skills, and investing in the mastery of tools like vim and terminal commandas to help me be productive at work. I enjoy doing all these things, but I also expected them to pay off well over time and afford me a life where I can do work that is rewarding and pays enough so I and my family don't have to think too much about money.

The rapid advance of AI tools in recent months make me question whether this is still the best strategy. Here, I want to explore my thinking on this.

What could I possibly do instead? I could learn about what industries and skills are most likley to be automated away over the next decade, take stock to what effect I'm likely affected, and then start pivoting towards building skills and career paths that I also enjoy but are less likely to be impacted as much or as soon. For instance: being able to write beautiful code is likely going to be less valuable quite soon, while critical and scientific thinking seem harder to automate[^eloundou2023gpt]; does this mean that I should spend my morning hours learning about experimentation instead of improving my vim and Python skills? Or should I pivot away from a technical towards a managerial role?

To answer these questions, I'm gonna proceed as follows:

-  Understand well how likely it is that the technical data science work I love and currently do is going to be automated away over the next two decades.

-  If it's not very likely then for now, I might not have to worry too much. If so, understand what skills are likely and unlikely to be automated.

- Ask myself what kind of career I want to have: even if technical work is not going to be automated away, possesing the relevant skills will almost definitely mean very reapid and constant learning. At the same time, managerial roles will also demand rapid learning, but it seems plausible that the fundamental skills that make a good manager are more enduring, which means its more a matter of continuous growth rather than a race to keep up. What kind of work life do I want?

- Given all the above, think about what direction I should move towards.


The Economist had some good coverage on the issue recently. They are predicting that while AI will transform work, it won't make redundant as many jobs as people might think, at least not as fast. They give a few reasons for this:

- Regulation (both in terms of what AI is allowed to do and the impact its allowed to have on labour markets) might limit its impact on the labout market.

- Widespread adaptation of new technologies has historically taken a long time.

- Historically, new technologies have destroyed some jobs while created new ones that were previously unimaginable -- (Autor et al. 2020 study)
