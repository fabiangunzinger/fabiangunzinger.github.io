Our first baby is about to be born, and with family and friends spread all over, Molly and I want to start a blog to share familly updates with loved ones.

Apart from a nice appearance, and the ability to create posts and upload photos easily, which should be standard across all platforms, we want two extra features: a way for people to sign up to be notified when we upload a new post, and password protection for the site.
