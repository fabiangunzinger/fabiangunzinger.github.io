Okay, here we go. I just had the strong desire to write, so here I go.

I don't even know what precisely I wanted to write about. I'm not sure there is anything to write about, really.

So, I just switched my seat in the cafe, but its not really better. There are trade-offs everywhere.

Whatever. I don't think I actually have anything to write about. Or do I.

Last week I had what M called a tiny masculinity crisis. It's all the old things reasserting themselves. Fundamentally, the realisation that I'm not as exceptional as I thought I'd be by this age. And the feeling that, given how hard I worked, I should be.

We also agreed that it would be good for me to get therapy, especially as long as I'm on private health care. I think this could really help. But it would also mean my taking some time to actully find a therapist.

This is quite nice. But I don't want the statusbar.
