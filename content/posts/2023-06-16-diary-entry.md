Yesterday, I've struggled yet again with motivation to do any work, and, as a result, barely did any. I felt similar to how I did a couple months ago when I realised I had to stop my intense early-morning learning sessions. It might well be that all the time spend on Neovim and Mac setup was again a bit too much, because I fell into the same trap I often do: I get caught up in the moment and don't stop work sessions early enough, pushing myself to a point that's unsustainable over time. I came across a saying the other day that I wanted to write about here, but I forgot what it was just now. I had it just a minute ago and now it's gone. But the point is that I need to get better at timeboxing when working on personal and work projects. The saying -- more of an insight than a saying, really -- is that people overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can do in 10 years. That is true for myself, too, and is ultimately the reason I push myself too hard on any single day: the sense that I need to make progress right now.

I do know that the ideal approach is to do little focused work every day over a long period of time. But I can't get myself to do it. I either get so absorbed that I can't stop for hours, or I have such trouble starting that I get nothing done whatsoever. This is crazy. It seems like such a simple thing to do, and yet I don't manage most of the time. The solution, I think, is to have clear rules for myself, and setting timers to help me enforce them. I want to aim for, say, two hours of deep work on work projects, and no more than one hour of deep work on personal projects each day. That's it. Nothing more. This is actually what I'm going to try. Two hours of deep work on work projects sounds like very little, but I'm pretty sure I don't do this on average. I have the occasional day where I do more. But most days I do much less, and the average is considerably below that I'd think. So this is a reasonable place to start.

I'm starting to see a therapist. I have believed for a long time that anyone who can afford it should have one, and known for almost as long that there are specific things in my life it could be helpful for. At the broadest level, that's because I can feel myself that there is something within me that holds me back from fully enjoying and appreciating my life, and it's related to my current role at work and my physique. In both domains I've worked hard for more than a decade, and have had certain expectations about what that work would have led to by the time I'm in my mid and late thirties. About to turn 38, I'm solidly at that point now, and feel that my competence at work and physique are not what I hoped for. Realising this so clearly over the past few months has been a bit of a reckoning. A clear case where the only way forward is to see and embrace reality as it is, but that's easier said than done. I know this is the way to go at an intellectual level, but it doesn't come instinctively. I can be grateful for the beautiful flat M and I moved into recently, but I can't help feel that at this stage in my life, I should be owning a beautiful house in a similarly spectacular location.

Now, it's possible that I overestimated myself and that the ideas I had my life were never realistic. But I don't think that's true. I did feel that I stood out in many contexts ever since I started to be serious about learning and studying, and have had many people tell me so or treat me accordingly. There were numerous instances that built up my belief that there was nothing I couldn't do if I did set my mind to, and was genuinely curious where the boundary was -- could I become a federal councilor? Win a Nobel Prize? It started in Toronto, where I started my English course with barely knowing any English, wanted to pass the Cambridge Advanced Certificate with Grade A, and did. (Actually, to go on a bit of a digression: that sense started to build earlier in other realms, too: I wanted to be a good goalie and was, I wanted to be exceptionally good at karate and was, I wanted to be a Grenadier in the Swiss Army and did.) At HSLU, I didn't to particularly well, but felt special because I had decided that I wanted to become an academic and felt way more intellectual than just about anyone around me given the kind of books I read. Then, at UZH, ...
