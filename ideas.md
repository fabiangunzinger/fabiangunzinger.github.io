## Ideas for posts
- [ ] Linear algebra of OLS
- [ ] FWL theorem
- [ ] Another post on CUPED
    - [ ] Once done, update my website and send link to series to data science newsletters and ask them to promote it
- [ ] Revenue per employee for Basecamp and other companies (is basecamp really that efficient? What other companies are, too? Look into Twitter pre and post layoffs, look at Meta.)
