    "A small company makes loans of up to 25k to be repaid a year later. 75 percent of loans are repaid in full, 20 percent of loans are repaid in half, the rest are not repaid. The company discounts the future at an annual rate of 5 percent. How much would the company be willing to loan if it wants to break even on average?\n",

Because that repayment occurs a year from now while the loan is made today, the company calculates the repayment's present value as: (1/1.05)21250 = 20238.1. Assuming that loan repayment is independent of loan size, then this is the loan size for which the company will break even on average (if it makes enough loans).\n",
