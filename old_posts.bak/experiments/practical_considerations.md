## Notes on crook2009seven

From Kohavi papers

Misc:
- Have an overall evaluation criterion
- Run A/A tests (run entire process but assign all groups to control) to test infrastructure and randomsation.

Analysis:
- Mine the data (check effects by subgroups like browser version, etc.)

Beware of:
- Dynamic effects (primacy or newness)
- Multiple concurrent experiments
