    "    2. Execute the entire module.\n",

    "    3. Create a name -- identical to the module name -- within the caller namespace that references to the module. This can be used to access module objects in the caller namespace as `module.object`.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Calling `from module import symbol` imports `symbol` into the current namespace. However, the global namespace for symbol (if it's a function) always remains the namespace in which it was defined, not the caller's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One reason `from module import *` is generally discouraged is that it directly imports all the module's objects into the caller's namespace, which is often said to cluter it up. Especially when importing large modules this makes sense, as it's much cleaner to keep objects defined in imported modules in eponymous namespaces and accessing them via `module.object`, which immediately makes clear where `object` comes from and can help greatly with debugging."

    "- For relative imports to work as described, for instance, [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages) and in Chapter 8 in Python Essential References and in recipees 10.1 and 10.3 in the Python Cookbook, the file into which you import has itself to be a module rather than a top-level script. If it's the latter, it's name will be __main__ and it won't be considered part of a package, regardless of where on the file system it is saved. Generally, for a file to be considered part of a package, it needs to nave a dot (.) in its name, as in package.submodule.modulename.
